/**
 * @classdesc
 * The Gamepad Plugin is an input plugin that belongs to the Scene-owned Input system.
 *
 * Its role is to listen for native DOM Gamepad Events and then process them.
 *
 * You do not need to create this class directly, the Input system will create an instance of it automatically.
 *
 * You can access it from within a Scene using `this.input.gamepad`.
 *
 * To listen for a gamepad being connected:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * this.input.gamepad.once('connected', function (pad) {
 *     //   'pad' is a reference to the gamepad that was just connected
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Note that the browser may require you to press a button on a gamepad before it will allow you to access it,
 * this is for security reasons. However, it may also trust the page already, in which case you won't get the
 * 'connected' event and instead should check `GamepadPlugin.total` to see if it thinks there are any gamepads
 * already connected.
 *
 * Once you have received the connected event, or polled the gamepads and found them enabled, you can access
 * them via the built-in properties `GamepadPlugin.pad1` to `pad4`, for up to 4 game pads. With a reference
 * to the gamepads you can poll its buttons and axis sticks. See the properties and methods available on
 * the `Gamepad` class for more details.
 *
 * As of September 2020 Chrome, and likely other browsers, will soon start to require that games requesting
 * access to the Gamepad API are running under SSL. They will actively block API access if they are not.
 *
