/**
 * @classdesc
 * A Pointer object encapsulates both mouse and touch input within Phaser.
 *
 * By default, Phaser will create 2 pointers for your game to use. If you require more, i.e. for a multi-touch
 * game, then use the `InputPlugin.addPointer` method to do so, rather than instantiating this class directly,
 * otherwise it won't be managed by the input system.
 *
 * You can reference the current active pointer via `InputPlugin.activePointer`. You can also use the properties
 * `InputPlugin.pointer1` through to `pointer10`, for each pointer you have enabled in your game.
 *
 * The properties of this object are set by the Input Plugin during processing. This object is then sent in all
 * input related events that the Input Plugin emits, so you can reference properties from it directly in your
 * callbacks.
