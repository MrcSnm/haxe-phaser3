/**
 * @classdesc
 * The Curve Shape is a Game Object that can be added to a Scene, Group or Container. You can
 * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling
 * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your
 * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.
 *
 * This shape supports both fill and stroke colors.
 *
 * To render a Curve Shape you must first create a `Phaser.Curves.Curve` object, then pass it to
 * the Curve Shape in the constructor.
 *
 * The Curve shape also has a `smoothness` property and corresponding `setSmoothness` method.
 * This allows you to control how smooth the shape renders in WebGL, by controlling the number of iterations
 * that take place during construction. Increase and decrease the default value for smoother, or more
 * jagged, shapes.
 *
 * @class Curve
 * @extends Phaser.GameObjects.Shape
 * @memberof Phaser.GameObjects
 * @constructor
 * @since 3.13.0
 *
 * @param {Phaser.Scene} scene - The Scene to which this Game Object belongs. A Game Object can only belong to one Scene at a time.
 * @param {number} [x=0] - The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.
 * @param {number} [y=0] - The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.
 * @param {Phaser.Curves.Curve} [curve] - The Curve object to use to create the Shape.
 * @param {number} [fillColor] - The color the curve will be filled with, i.e. 0xff0000 for red.
 * @param {number} [fillAlpha] - The alpha the curve will be filled with. You can also set the alpha of the overall Shape using its `alpha` property.
