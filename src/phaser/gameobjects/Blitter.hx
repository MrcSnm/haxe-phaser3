/**
 * @classdesc
 * A Blitter Game Object.
 *
 * The Blitter Game Object is a special kind of container that creates, updates and manages Bob objects.
 * Bobs are designed for rendering speed rather than flexibility. They consist of a texture, or frame from a texture,
 * a position and an alpha value. You cannot scale or rotate them. They use a batched drawing method for speed
 * during rendering.
 *
 * A Blitter Game Object has one texture bound to it. Bobs created by the Blitter can use any Frame from this
 * Texture to render with, but they cannot use any other Texture. It is this single texture-bind that allows
 * them their speed.
 *
 * If you have a need to blast a large volume of frames around the screen then Blitter objects are well worth
 * investigating. They are especially useful for using as a base for your own special effects systems.
