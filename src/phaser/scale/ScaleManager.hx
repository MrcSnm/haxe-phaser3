/**
 * @classdesc
 * The Scale Manager handles the scaling, resizing and alignment of the game canvas.
 *
 * The way scaling is handled is by setting the game canvas to a fixed size, which is defined in the
 * game configuration. You also define the parent container in the game config. If no parent is given,
 * it will default to using the document body. The Scale Manager will then look at the available space
 * within the _parent_ and scale the canvas accordingly. Scaling is handled by setting the canvas CSS
 * width and height properties, leaving the width and height of the canvas element itself untouched.
 * Scaling is therefore achieved by keeping the core canvas the same size and 'stretching'
 * it via its CSS properties. This gives the same result and speed as using the `transform-scale` CSS
 * property, without the need for browser prefix handling.
 *
 * The calculations for the scale are heavily influenced by the bounding parent size, which is the computed
 * dimensions of the canvas's parent. The CSS rules of the parent element play an important role in the
 * operation of the Scale Manager. For example, if the parent has no defined width or height, then actions
 * like auto-centering will fail to achieve the required result. The Scale Manager works in tandem with the
 * CSS you set-up on the page hosting your game, rather than taking control of it.
 *
 * #### Parent and Display canvas containment guidelines:
 *
 * - Style the Parent element (of the game canvas) to control the Parent size and thus the games size and layout.
 *
 * - The Parent element's CSS styles should _effectively_ apply maximum (and minimum) bounding behavior.
 *
 * - The Parent element should _not_ apply a padding as this is not accounted for.
 *   If a padding is required apply it to the Parent's parent or apply a margin to the Parent.
 *   If you need to add a border, margin or any other CSS around your game container, then use a parent element and
 *   apply the CSS to this instead, otherwise you'll be constantly resizing the shape of the game container.
 *
 * - The Display canvas layout CSS styles (i.e. margins, size) should not be altered / specified as
 *   they may be updated by the Scale Manager.
 *
 * #### Scale Modes
 *
 * The way the scaling is handled is determined by the `scaleMode` property. The default is `NONE`,
 * which prevents Phaser from scaling or touching the canvas, or its parent, at all. In this mode, you are
 * responsible for all scaling. The other scaling modes afford you automatic scaling.
 *
 * If you wish to scale your game so that it always fits into the available space within the parent, you
 * should use the scale mode `FIT`. Look at the documentation for other scale modes to see what options are
 * available. Here is a basic config showing how to set this scale mode:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * scale: {
 *     parent: 'yourgamediv',
 *     mode: Phaser.Scale.FIT,
 *     width: 800,
 *     height: 600
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Place the `scale` config object within your game config.
 *
 * If you wish for the canvas to be resized directly, so that the canvas itself fills the available space
 * (i.e. it isn't scaled, it's resized) then use the `RESIZE` scale mode. This will give you a 1:1 mapping
 * of canvas pixels to game size. In this mode CSS isn't used to scale the canvas, it's literally adjusted
 * to fill all available space within the parent. You should be extremely careful about the size of the
 * canvas you're creating when doing this, as the larger the area, the more work the GPU has to do and it's
 * very easy to hit fill-rate limits quickly.
 *
 * For complex, custom-scaling requirements, you should probably consider using the `RESIZE` scale mode,
 * with your own limitations in place re: canvas dimensions and managing the scaling with the game scenes
 * yourself. For the vast majority of games, however, the `FIT` mode is likely to be the most used.
 *
 * Please appreciate that the Scale Manager cannot perform miracles. All it does is scale your game canvas
 * as best it can, based on what it can infer from its surrounding area. There are all kinds of environments
 * where it's up to you to guide and help the canvas position itself, especially when built into rendering
 * frameworks like React and Vue. If your page requires meta tags to prevent user scaling gestures, or such
 * like, then it's up to you to ensure they are present in the html.
 *
 * #### Centering
 *
 * You can also have the game canvas automatically centered. Again, this relies heavily on the parent being
 * properly configured and styled, as the centering offsets are based entirely on the available space
 * within the parent element. Centering is disabled by default, or can be applied horizontally, vertically,
 * or both. Here's an example:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * scale: {
 *     parent: 'yourgamediv',
 *     autoCenter: Phaser.Scale.CENTER_BOTH,
 *     width: 800,
 *     height: 600
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * #### Fullscreen API
 *
 * If the browser supports it, you can send your game into fullscreen mode. In this mode, the game will fill
 * the entire display, removing all browser UI and anything else present on the screen. It will remain in this
 * mode until your game either disables it, or until the user tabs out or presses ESCape if on desktop. It's a
 * great way to achieve a desktop-game like experience from the browser, but it does require a modern browser
 * to handle it. Some mobile browsers also support this.
